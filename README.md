# ML and knot theory 
This repo contains demontrations of two possible ways to apply machine learning techniques on knot theory. More details will be explained at the [CMSA workshop](https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/machine-learning-and-mathematical-conjecture/).

The notebooks are slightly modified from the repos of DeepMind and Tensorlow. The orginal versions can be opened on colab without installation: 
- DeepMind - https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/mathematics_conjectures/blob/main/knot_theory.ipynb#scrollTo=xQnp2V1cvdxy
- Tensorflow_VAE - https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/cvae.ipynb

Alternatively, to run the code locally, the neccessay packages can be installed by

    pip install jax haiku matplotlib optax pandas seaborn scikit-learn gsutil  tensorflow tensorflow_probability glob imageio 

A virtual environment is recommended.
